1. How do you control for biases?
    - Randomization
    - Blinding
    - Statistical Adjustment
    - Adjusting Sample Size

2. What are confounding variables?
    Confounding variables are factors other than the independent variable that might affect the dependent variable in a study, 
    leading to incorrect conclusions about the relationship between the independent and dependent variables. 

3. What is A/B testing?
    A/B testing is a randomized control experiment where two versions (A and B) are compared, 
    which are identical except for one variation that might affect a user's behavior. 
    Version A might be the currently used version (control), while version B is modified in some respect (treatment). 

4. When will you use Welch t-test?
    The Welch t-test is used instead of the standard Student's t-test when the two samples have unequal variances and possibly unequal sample sizes. 
    It is more reliable in these conditions and adjusts the degrees of freedom used in the significance test to accommodate the sample variance differences.

5. A company claims that the average time its customer service representatives spend on the phone per call is 6 minutes. 
You believe that the average time is actually higher. You collect a random sample of 50 calls and find that the average time 
spent on the phone per call in your sample is 6.5 minutes, with a standard deviation of 1.2 minutes. Test whether there is sufficient 
evidence to support your claim at a significance level of 0.05.
    Sample mean: 6.5 minutes
    Standard deviation: 1.2 minutes
    Sample size: 50

    Given a p-value of 0.0025, which is less than the significance level of 0.05, we reject the null hypothesis. 
    There is sufficient evidence to support the claim that the average time spent on the phone per call is greater than 6 minutes.

6. A researcher wants to determine whether there is a difference in the mean scores of two groups of students on a math test. 
Group A consists of 25 students who received traditional teaching methods, while Group B consists of 30 students who received a new teaching method. 
The average score for Group A is 75, with a standard deviation of 8, and the average score for Group B is 78, with a standard deviation of 7. 
Test whether there is a significant difference in the mean scores of the two groups at a significance level of 0.05.

    Group A : Mean = 75, Standard deviation = 8, Number of students = 25
    Group B : Mean = 78, Standard deviation = 7, Number of students = 30

    With a p-value of 0.176, which is greater than the significance level of 0.05, we fail to reject the null hypothesis. 
    There is insufficient evidence to support the claim that there is a significant difference in the mean scores between the two groups.
